    "## I.Definition:\n",
    "#### Project Overview:\n",
    "   * Now a days everyone is watching movies and give rating or review for that whether it is good or bad.With this information I have an idea to predict the score of the particular movie based on the rating given by the audience and voting. \n",
    "   * Hence an analysis is made by Preetish panda, which was posted in Linkedin. Source :- https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/analyzing-imdb-movie-dataset-preetish-panda\n",
    "   * By the sheer exploration of the data it is possible to develop certain score based on the related charactersitics or features which can be used to give information about that movie whether it is good or bad.\n",
    "   * Hence, in this project I developed a model that can predict the metascore by using rating of a particular movie and votes polled to that movie and revenue i.e howmuch money invested on that movie and genres i.e comedy,drama,horror,adventures,sci_fi,romance etc and actors etc.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Problem Statement:\n",
    "   * The goal is to develop a model that can predict the score 'Chance Of Admit', that determines an individuals chances of getting an admission in the university he desires to pursue his/her education.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * The tasks involved are :-\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * Download and preprocess the imdb data.\n",
    "   * Train a BenchMark Model and record it's performance.\n",
    "   * Then three supervised learning models were trained using the training data and a comparision is done based on the performance metric and decided which among the three is the best model.\n",
    "   * The best model thus selected is optimized using GridSearchCV technique.\n",
    "   * The Optimized model is then compared with the Benchmark model and deciding which is the best for the given data.\n",
    "   * Then the best model is validated aganist unseen data and documenting the intuition.\n",
    "   * The final model can be applied to determine the metascore of a particular movie with the givrn features. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Metric:\n",
    "   * The current problem is a Regression task, since it takes certain features as inputs and attempts to find a score that helps an individual to get an idea about particular movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Hence, Coefficient Of Determination is considered as the performance metric that can be applied to compare the performances of the scores obtained from the BenchMark and the Optimal Model considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The CoEfficient Of Determination(R^2) is the key output of the Regression Analysis.It can be defined as the proportion of the varaince in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   It's values ranges from 0 to 1, and the results are given intuition by, if:-\n",
    "\n",
    "    The value of R^2 -> 0 , indicates that the model is a worst fit to the given data.\n",
    "    The value of R^2 -> 1 , indicates that the model is the best fit to the given data.\n",
    "    The value of R^2 in between 0 and 1 -> indicates that the respective variability exhibited by the target variable.\n",
    "    The formula for CoEfficient Of Determination(R^2) is given by :- fed29779d54adeccdec58f0894870c680f3d6b5b.svg\n",
    "\n",
    "    From the above formula SSreg is called Sum of Squares of Residuals, also called the Residual Sum of Squares: Source :-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_sum_of_squares\n",
    "\n",
    "    And the SStot is called the Total Number of Squares. Source :-https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_sum_of_squares"

    "## ALGORITHMS AND TECHNIQUES\n",
    "By observing the problem, it is quite evident that it is a 'Regression' Problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to understand the intuition behind the consideration of specific model, since it has to generate an optimal possibility of results that can improve the model's performance on a sample of new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, taking the performance of the model into consideration, I chose three Supervised Machine Learning Algorithms that can be better compatible for the data being available.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are :-\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble Methods - i) Random Forests, ii)GradientBoostingRegressor\n",
    "iii)Lasso\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ensemble Methods - Random Forests :-\n",
    "\n",
    "Random forests are an ensemble learning method for classification, regression and other tasks, that operate by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes in case of the classification tasks or mean prediction for the regression tasks of the individual trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random forests have a stroke of brilliance when a performance optimization happens to enhance precision of the model, or vice versa.Tuning down the fraction of features that is considered at any given node can let you easily work on datasets with thousands of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Random Forests perform well on almost every machine learning problem and they also show less overfit behavior when compared to Decision Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GradientBoosstingRegressor:\n",
    "Gradient Boosting Regresor is a ensemble algorithm for both classification and regression.GBTs build trees one at a time, where each new tree helps to correct errors made by previously trained tree. With each tree added, the model becomes even more expressive. There are typically three parameters - number of trees, depth of trees and learning rate, and the each tree built is generally shallow. \n",
    "\n",
    "  Although it may seem GBDTs are better than random forests, GBDTs are prone to overfitting, however there are strategies to overcome same and build more generalized trees using a combination of parameters like learning rate (shrinkage) and depth of tree.  Generally the two parameters are kept on the lower side to allow for slow learning and better generalization. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lasso:\n",
    "It is one of the regresion technique.It uses regularisation.LASSO stands for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. I know it doesn’t give much of an idea but there are 2 key words here – ‘absolute‘ and ‘selection‘.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Feature Tranformation :-\n",
    "\n",
    " * Feature transformation is an important concept in the Data Preprocessing phase which involves the tranformation of relevent numerical data into the range of 0 to 1 by using min_max_scaler which is available in sklearn.preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    " * We also need to transform the categorial data into numerical data by using get_dummies()."

    "## Reflection:\n",
    "  * The process used for this project can be summarized using the following steps:-\n",
    "\n",
    "   * A Common Problem on Graduate Admissions is found in \"Kaggle\" and the data set related to it is acquired from the Public Domain.\n",
    "   * The Dataset was downloaded and loaded for the current project and necessary statistics were calculated.\n",
    "   * The Data Set is Explored with scatter-plots to illustrate the correlation of the input features with respect to the target variable.\n",
    "   * The Data Set is preprocessed using the technique \"Feature Selection\" and irrelevant attributes are removed from the dataset.\n",
    "   * Feature transfromation is vary important for this project.In this project first of all we have to convert the categorial data into numerical data by using get_dummies.\n",
    "   * A function is designed that calculates the performance metric r2_score and returns that score.\n",
    "   * The data is splitted into 75% training and 25% testing data.\n",
    "   * A BenchMark was created for the Regressor i.e, here Linear Regressor acts as a BenchMark Model and is trained using the training data.\n",
    "   * Then three supervised learning models were trained using the training data and a comparision is done based on the performance metric and decided which among the three is the best model.\n",
    "   * The best model thus selected is optimized by the application of 'GridSearchCV'.\n",
    "   * The optimized model is then compared with the BenchMark Model and came to the conclusion that the Optimzed Model shows a better performance than the BenchMark model.\n",
    "   * Finally the Optimized Model which is selected as the best model for the input data is validated aganist unseen data and the performance and intuition was documented clearly.\n",
    "  I personally found that the features which are important for the data is very difficult.Because it's giving low r2_score values when we run with some important features.Again if we run with some other important then it  increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "  But finally it is giving low r2_score value which i think that it is suitable for this dataset."

    "## IMPROVEMENT\n",
    "   * Potentially the 'Data Preprocessing' phase is the crucial part of any Machine Learning Problem, Since during this phase we can potentially identify the flaws in the data set that could actually mess the results and performance of the model thus considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Hence, removing irrelevant data during this phase can predominantly increase the model's performance and can benefit in generalized results.\n",
    "   * Since, this is a regression task, the Wrapper Method implementation i.e., RFE may not be the best one.\n",
    "   * There is also room for trying Embedded method such as LASSO and Elastic Net and Ridge Regression that don't need the external implementation of the feature selection techniques , since these methods have embedded feature selection and regularization built in. It's worth a trial, since there is always scope for improving the model performance aganist the given dataset.\n",
    "   * Further more, some ensemble methods such as 'XGBOOST' should also take care of larger data dimensions and these methods can themselves be used for feature selection."
